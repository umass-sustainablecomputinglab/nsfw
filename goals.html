<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Public cloud computing is rapidly becoming the foundation of our Information-based economy. Providers already offer a diversity of products with even more variety in the offing. These products range from the more mature and well-established IaaS (bare metal or virtual machines and containers) to PaaS/SaaS and the more recent function-as-a-service (FaaS).  Users are adopting cloud platforms for the relatively subjective reasons of "toil reduction" and "distraction reduction,‚Äù as well as the more quantifiable reasons of cost savings (involving cap-ex/op-ex tradeoffs) over using in-house infrastructure.</p>

<p>The primary focus of cloud providers so far has largely been on offering interesting and robust products and services to capture a large user-base. Growing competition will make it increasingly important that they also operate their infrastructure more efficiently (e.g., by leveraging yield management techniques to multiplex multiple workloads and even overbook resources). In general, well-functioning markets are important for using resources efficiently as markets bring together buyers and sellers with the goal of ensuring all resources are sold at an equilibrium price that balances supply and demand. As public cloud platforms have sought to attract demand and increase their utilization, they have naturally evolved to resemble <em>nascent markets</em> for IT resources. This raises new research challenges for both users and providers that are inherently economic. Users must design cost-aware systems that are capable of navigating the market's complexity by automatically selecting and configuring cloud services to balance ease-of-use, cost, risk, performance, and availability. Providers, meanwhile, must design and offer cloud services in the market that are easy to use, maximize utilization and revenue, satisfy diverse application requirements, and cannot be <em>gamed</em>. While the computer systems and networking communities have a long history of research into various forms of economic resource allocation, the emerging cloud market differs from prior research in multiple important respects, as summarized below.</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
<li><strong>Explicit Costs.</strong> Whereas many earlier systems and networks have used market-based mechanisms for resource allocation, these markets and the associated currencies were <em>virtual</em>. The public cloud marketplace charges real money and thus makes the cost of using resources and services explicit.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Choices.</strong> It offers myriad services to choose from with different abstractions at multiple levels of the software stack with distinct pricing models and tradeoffs. It also offers very diverse IT abstractions from the more conventional (virtual) machines to the more recent software interfaces (SaaS and FaaS).</li> 
<li><strong>Risk Exposure.</strong> It exposes applications to many novel forms of uncertainty and risk that applications must consider when selecting services, as these risks have costs.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Environment.</strong> It is arguably an even more dynamic environment than traditional systems with prices that change over time based on both variable application workloads and variable market prices.</li>
<li><strong>Design Impact.</strong> It affects the design of cloud systems, since these systems have an incentive to respond and adapt to workload and price dynamics by continuously re-configuring themselves. In particular, many issues related to "mechanism design" (e.g., choosing pricing structures, choosing performance SLA levels) are fundamentally novel and may not be mere adaptations of existing solutions from other domains.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from computer systems and networking and from the fields of economics, finance, and operations research to define the important research challenges at this intersection over the next 5-10 years. A key goal is to understand how services offered by cloud market affects the design of cloud applications, which have historically optimized for traditional metrics, such as performance, availability, energy-efficiency, etc., and not economic metrics, such as cost and risk. In particular, the objectives and intellectual merit of the workshop include:</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
<li>Foster a community working at the intersection of cloud computing and economics that includes academic researchers from computer systems design and economics, finance, and operations research.</li>
<li>Set the vision for this community and identify the key challenges and open problems related to designing services for cloud markets and designing cloud applications to optimize for those markets.</li>
<li>Engage industry participants that are actively working at this intersection, introduce them to this community, and get their feedback on key challenges and open problems from their perspective.</li>
</ul>
