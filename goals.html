<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Public cloud computing is rapidly becoming the foundation of our Information-based economy, providing the large-scale computing power needed to advance nearly every segment of society, including transportation, energy, communication, healthcare, science, and entertainment. Users are adopting cloud platforms in lieu of maintaining a dedicated computing infrastructure primarily due to their lower cost.  While cloud platforms only charge users based on how many resources they use, users must pay for a dedicated computing infrastructure regardless of whether they use it.  Since a dedicated computing infrastructure often operates at low utilizations, e.g., 33% or less, its users end up paying for a large fraction of resources they do not use.  In addition to low costs, cloud platforms offer numerous other benefits:  they are simpler to configure and use, require no maintenance, incur no upfront capital expenses, and provide the illusion of near-infinite scalability.</p>

<p>Cloud platforms are able to offer lower costs by multiplexing their resources among a large customer base to operate at much higher utilizations, e.g., 60% or more, than a dedicated infrastructure.  Since cloud platforms earn revenue from utilizing their infrastructure by renting it out to customers, and earn no revenue if their infrastructure is idle, their goal is to maximize utilization.  Achieving this goal has led to an intense competition in the cloud "market" to offer a combination of low cost, high performance, and easy-to-use cloud services.   In general, well-functioning markets are important to maximizing any resource's utilization, as markets bring together buyers and sellers with the goal of ensuring all resources are sold at an equilibrium price that balances supply and demand.  As public cloud platforms have sought to attract demand and increase their utilization, they have evolved to resemble nascent markets for computational resources.</p>
 
<p>In 2006, when Amazon Web Services (AWS) started its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), it enabled users to rent a few different types of servers for a fixed per-hour price at one location.  Today, AWS has evolved to offer a wide array of cloud services that support numerous interfaces and cost models, which present complex tradeoffs between ease-of-use, cost, risk, performance, and availability.   EC2 users can now choose from nearly 100 different types of server configurations in dozens of geographical regions under a variety of cost models, e.g., on-demand, reserved, spot, burstable, dedicated, etc.  In addition to EC2, AWS offers over 75 additional cloud services in 18 different service categories, e.g., compute, storage, database, artificial intelligence, etc., each presenting its own tradeoffs.   Competing cloud providers, including Microsoft, Google, and IBM, offer a similarly diverse array of services. In addition, third-parties can also layer their own "virtual" cloud services atop these "native" clouds to automatically optimize resource allocation across multiple native platforms, or to tailor their service's interface and cost model to specific applications. The number of both native and third-party cloud services is continuing to grow, presenting users with increasingly complex choices in how to design cost-efficient cloud applications.</p>

<p>The increasing complexity of cloud markets raises new research challenges for both users and providers that are inherently <em>economic</em>. Users must design cost-aware systems that are capable of navigating the market's complexity by automatically selecting and configuring cloud services to balance ease-of-use, cost, risk, performance, and availability.  Providers, meanwhile, must design and offer cloud services in the market that are easy to use, maximize utilization and revenue, satisfy diverse application requirements, and cannot be "gamed."   While the computer systems and networking communities have a long history of research into various forms of "market-based" resource allocation, the emerging cloud market differs from prior research in multiple important respects, as summarized below. </p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
<li><strong>Explicit Costs.</strong> Whereas many earlier systems and networks have used market-based mechanisms for resource allocation, these markets and the associated currencies were <em>virtual</em>. The public cloud marketplace charges real money and thus makes the cost of using resources and services explicit.  
<li><strong>Strong Incentives.</strong> It includes strong incentives to minimize cost, subject to a target level of performance, availability, risk, etc. by making optimal decisions, or gaming the market.
<li><strong>Complex Choices.</strong> It offers myriad services to choose from with different abstractions at multiple levels of the software stack with distinct pricing models and tradeoffs.
<li><strong>Risk Exposure.</strong>  It exposes applications to many novel forms of uncertainty and risk that applications must consider when selecting services, as these risks have costs.
<li><strong>Dynamic Environment.</strong> It is arguably an even more dynamic environment than traditional systems with prices that change over time based on both variable application workloads and variable market prices. 
<li><strong>Design Impact.</strong> It affects the design of cloud systems, since these systems have an incentive to respond and adapt to workload and price dynamics by continuously re-configuring themselves.
</ul>

<p>In general, software developers, even those highly trained in DevOps, do not have the economic background to handle the market's complexity and make optimal decisions, especially given the dynamic nature of the market and application workloads, which requires adapting their resource allocation as supply, demand, and hence prices change.</p> 

<p>While much recent research has focused on optimizing various decisions in cloud markets, e.g., which VM to select for specific applications, the work largely derives from the computer systems and networking communities and does not sufficiently leverage relevant ideas from the fields of economics, finance, and operations research.  Similarly, while these fields are devoted to optimizing the resource allocation of a variety of commodities and services, including IT-related), they have not yet focused much attention on the unique aspects of the public cloud marketplace. The emergence of the cloud and the maturation of virtualization technologies, e.g., VMs, nested VMs, and containers, has made computation an increasingly fungible commodity, similar in many respects to other types of commodities considered in economics and finance.  Thus, there is the potential to adapt techniques from economics and finance to aid both providers in structuring cloud markets, e.g., which services to offer and how to price them, and consumers in making cost-effective allocation decisions.  One clear example of this potential is EC2's spot market for VMs, which resembles spot markets for other commodities, particularly electricity, and has a similar goal---to sell and gain revenue from any unused resources for the highest price.  As in other spot markets, EC2's variant requires applications to place a bid for resources, such that if a user's bid price exceeds the current spot price, it immediately allocates the resources and the application pays the variable spot price for them. </p> 

<p>However, the relationship between applications, cloud services, and their underlying computational resources is fundamentally different and more complex than other commodities, which will require a re-thinking of traditional approaches in economics and finance.   For example, cloud resources and services are not simply passive investments that can be bought and sold independent of the higher-level applications they support.  These applications maintain meta-data about the resources they use, store volatile state on those resources, or synchronize their state across multiple resources in complex ways that affect their performance.  As a result, any decisions about changes in the set of resources must be tightly integrated with the application(s) that run on them.</p> 

<p>Consider the EC2 spot market example above:  if the spot price rises above an application's bid price, the platform immediately revokes the resources from the application and re-allocates them to the new highest bidder.  Applications must be designed to gracefully handle such revocations by re-configuring themselves to remove the lost resources.  However, since applications store the results of their computation in volatile memory state on these resources, such revocations can also impact performance by requiring applications to re-compute lost data.  Applications can mitigate the risk of such performance impacts by employing various fault-tolerance techniques that were originally designed to handle failures, but these techniques may incur their own overheads that degrade performance.  Establishing benchmarks for how well applications handle market volatility independent of price is also important.   For example, the recent CloudSort benchmark optimizes for low-cost execution but explicitly disqualifies spot market resources because spot prices vary over time.  Yet, in practice, efficiently handling volatility is an important design criteria for minimizing cost.  Of course, EC2's spot market is only one example of the intersection of economics and cloud computing. Cloud applications are complex systems composed of distributed sets of resources and cloud services connected together via network links, which may also be allocated and bandwidth-provisioned using market mechanisms.  Modern cloud applications may utilize these resources differently over time based on their changing workload, which in-turn affects the choice of which resources and cloud services are most cost-efficient.  Thus, optimizing applications for the cloud market requires a multi-disciplinary approach that cuts across computer systems design, networking, and economics.</p> 

<h3>Intellectual Merit</h3>
<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from computer systems and networking and from the fields of economics, finance, and operations research to define the important research challenges at this intersection over the next 5-10 years.  A key goal is to understand how services offered by cloud market affects the design of cloud applications, which have historically optimized for traditional metrics, such as performance, availability, energy-efficiency, etc., and not market metrics, such as cost and risk.  In particular, the objectives and intellectual merit of the workshop include:</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em;">
<li>Foster a community working at the intersection of cloud computing and economics that includes academic researchers from computer systems design and economics, finance, and operations research.</li>
<li>Set the vision for this community and identify the key challenges and open problems related to designing services for cloud markets and designing cloud applications to optimize for those markets.</li>
<li>Engage industry participants that are actively working at this intersection, introduce them to this community, and get their feedback on key challenges and open problems from their perspective.</li>
